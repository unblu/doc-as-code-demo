include::{github-readme}[tags=description]

In addition to this project page that explains the feature and concepts used for the "Documentation a code" setup, the output of this repository is also two guides:

* {overview-guide}: a small guide that you would give to your users or customers.
* {complete-guide}: a complete guide that contains more details. 
* {internal-guide}: a specific version of the complete guide for the team working on the project (it contains some text that is only for the team).

== Documentation features

=== Asciidoctor

There are many great presentations and articles that explain what is asciidoctor and why it is a good toolchain to implement "Documentation as Code".

https://asciidoctor.org/

==== Diagrams

Working with diagram is a standard Asciidoctor feature.

https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/

==== Syntax Highlighting

We currently support syntax highlighting for the following languages:

    Apache, Bash, C#, C++, CSS, CoffeeScript, Diff, HTML, XML, HTTP, Ini, TOML, JSON, Java, JavaScript, Makefile, Markdown, Nginx, Objective-C, PHP, Perl, Properties, Python, Ruby, SQL, Shell, Kotlin, TypeScript

If you want to add support for other languages, you can replace the bundle in `resource/highlight.min.js` with a new one from https://highlightjs.org/download/[highlightjs.org/download].


=== File structure

* git-link:docs/[`docs/`] all the documentation elements (article, images, ...)
* git-link:publish/[`publish/`] the final artifacts that will be published on GitHub pages. Those element reuse elements from the git-link:docs/[`docs/`] folder.

==== Elements in docs

This folder contains the text and the images that will be included in the final documentation.

The idea is to have multiple small pages corresponding to concepts or topics.
This is really similar to how a wiki would work.
Each of those pages can be read separatelly (as a standalone artifact).

With the `-Pdocs` arguement it is possible to make gradle render the git-link:docs/[`docs/`] folder insted of the git-link:publish/[`publish/`] one.

==== Elements in publish

The final documents (the two guides in this example) consume elements from the git-link:docs/[`docs/`] using the `include::` feature of asciidoctor.

==== Initialization

In order for the rendering or the preview of one separated file to work, some default configuration settings are put in git-link:docs/_init.adoc[`_init.adoc`].
The idea is to include this init once (if not already included) by checking if the `init` attribute is set.
At the end of the initialization phase, init is defined to `OK`.

The idea is that for different context (creating a final guide for example) an other initialization values can be set.
The guides (final document) are using git-link:publish/_init-complete-guide.adoc[`_init-complete-guide.adoc`] or git-link:publish/_init-overview-guide.adoc[`_init-overview-guide.adoc`] as an alternative to git-link:docs/_init.adoc[`_init.adoc`]

For initialization values that are common to the different initialization strategies, the file  git-link:docs/_common.adoc[`_common.adoc`] is included.

==== root attribute

In order to be able to move text from one file to the next, the `+{root}+` attribute always points to the relative location of the git-link:docs/[`docs/`] folder.

It must be used for links (see <<internal links>>).
It must also be used for images that will be included in the final document like svg files:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::{root}svg/ipsum.svg[Ipsum,300,opts=inline]
----


==== imgs attribute

The `+{imgs}+` is similar to the `+{root}+` attribute for the git-link:docs/imgs[`docs/imgs/`] folder.
Its value depends of the context:

* When previewing an adoc file (also called "standalone" display) (then it is `+{root}/imgs+`). This is also the case for the rendering made by GitHub.
* When generating the html output (the content of `docs` output folder using `-Pdocs` or the normal `guides` output folder), then its value depends of the location of the file (`docfile`) beeing processed, relative to `sourceDir`. This is because in the resulting html document, the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag is not the one in the source folder git-link:docs/[`docs/`] but a copy of the image that will be present in the output folder.

It must be used for images (`png`, `gif`, `jpeg` ...):

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::{imgs}example.png[]
----


==== internal links

Creating internal links directly between the pages of the git-link:docs/[`docs/`] folder is a bad practice.
During creation of the guides (in the git-link:publish/[`publish/`] folder), we do not know if the section where the link points will be part of the final document or not.

The idea is to use asciidoctor attributes instead of links.
In the <<Initialization>> file, those attributes are defined as link or as text.

Example:

[source,asciidoc]
.Definitions of the references in the init file
----
include::../docs/_init.adoc[tags=references]
----

There is a script to generate all references.
`// ALIAS: <some text>` is used to indicate additional references that must be created.

NOTE: TODO improve this section when the script is ready to be published (as gradle plugin for example).

Usage, in your text, instead of having a link `+<<{root}concepts/lorem.adoc#, finibus lorem>>+` the attribute `+{finibus-lorem}+` must be used:

[source,asciidoc]
.Usage of a reference attribute to create an internal link
----
include::../docs/concepts/ipsum.adoc[tags=link-example]
----

For demonstration purpose, the {overview-guide} do not contains any links and the {complete-guide} does.


== Build

This project is using gradle.

Command to build the documentation pages:

----
./gradlew asciidoctor
----

The output of this command is a collection HTML pages located at `<git repo root>/build/guides/html5/`.

Command to build the documentation standalone elements (content of the git-link:docs/[`docs/`] folder):

----
./gradlew asciidoctor -Pdocs
----

The output of this command is a collection HTML pages located at `<git repo root>/build/docs/html5/`.

A tool like link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server[live-server] (`npm install -g live-server`) can be used to have an auto-reloading browser.

----
live-server build/guides/html5/
live-server build/docs/html5/
----

=== For project maintainers

Command to upload the documentation page on GitHub pages:

----
./gradlew gitPublishPush
----

=== Using ssh-agent

Some tasks requires to push into the distant git repository.

If they are failing with errors like this:
----
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException: ... Permission denied (publickey).
----

Then `ssh-agent` can be used.
----
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----
